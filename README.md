# LockBot
The idea for this project is to create an open source web based app that simplifies lock cylinder biting charts. 
For anyone not famillira with what that is, its a critical tool locksmiths use to create and maintain Master Key Systems. 

#### more information comming soon. this repository is currently a pet project that makes sure i dont forget about the idea.
